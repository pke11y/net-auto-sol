# get next hops in VRF - 'sh ip bgp vpnv4 <VRF>' or 'sh ip bgp vpnv4 vrf <VRF> nexthops'
#     - how do we map RID back to node name - hostvars??
# get intf int in VRF per node - 'sh ip int vrf <VRF_NAME>'
# get CPE neighbor BGP - 'sh ip bgp vpnv4 vrf VRF_ACME summary'
#     - need IP address within /30 
#     - is CPE RID same as mgmt IP?


##

# RR - configure 'ip extcommunity-list 99 permit rt 65001:100'
# RR - run 'sh ip bgp vpnv4 all extcommunity-list 99' for networks and nexthop
 # or
# PE - get 'network' and 'nexthops' in VRF - 'sh ip bgp vpnv4 <VRF>'

# use 'nexthop' to get PE node, use 'network' to check if BGP neighbor is within the network
   # On PE get CPE from neighbor BGP - 'sh ip bgp vpnv4 vrf VRF_ACME neighbors'
